# Hybrid of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Stackelberg Game Theory
This is an agent with a hybrid framework of RL and Stackelberg Game Theory for the safety of tower crane operation.
This agent performed on multiple RL model, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN), and Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN).
The result shows that the agents that performed using the proposed framework have outstanding results in comparison to agent that used traditional method, which are static and random supervision level.
