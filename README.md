## Introduction
Hi, I am a developer who likes designing, coding, and experiencing. This repository records and stores my projects throughout my journey in learning AI development, data analytics, and app development.

## Project Scope
I started out working on projects that focused heavily on data analytics using Machine Learning and a variety of datasets. Along the way, I picked up a solid toolkit of data science techniques—from data scraping and preprocessing to EDA, model training, and data visualization. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into the world of Generative AI, exploring cutting-edge models like LLMs and NLP systems. I'm also expanding my skills in building AI-powered applications and understanding the end-to-end development process behind them.
